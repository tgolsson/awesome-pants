# Awesome Pants

This repository is a collection of great Pants tools, guides, and plugins.

It is driven by code generation; in order to be presented both as a website and as a README.

Each list is contained in a separate file in `/resources/`: `plugins` for plugins, and so on. Just follow the existing pattern and then run `pants generate` to regenerate all other lists! The website itself is rebuilt by CI and published, so you just need to ensure the README is regenerated.
